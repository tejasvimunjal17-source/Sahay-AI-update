"""pages/resources.py — PHASE 5: reorganized into the 10 named categories
from the approved Phase 5 scope, each with a practical suggestion and an
optional linked wellness activity (pointing at a pages/relaxation.py
activity key). Still static content, no persistence, no medical claims.

PHASE 6C: header swapped from a hand-rolled `st.markdown("### ...")` to
the shared components.page_components.page_header. No description was
added (none existed before). The category loop itself — icon/label/
description/tip/optional "Try a related activity" button, including the
exact widget keys and the `sahay_page="relaxation"` navigation — is
byte-identical to before; a plain `st.container(border=True)` per card
was kept rather than list_row, since each card carries three distinct
text fields plus a conditional button, not list_row's simpler
title+caption shape."""
