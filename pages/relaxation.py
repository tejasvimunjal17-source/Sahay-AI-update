"""pages/relaxation.py — PHASE 4: full activity detail (instructions,
duration, timer, completion), with completion logged to
wellness_activity_logs for authenticated users; Demo Mode shows the same
activities but doesn't log completion anywhere.

PHASE 6D: header swapped to components.page_components.render_page_header
(no description added — none existed before). ACTIVITIES and
_render_activity_card are untouched — per the Phase 6A audit, each
activity card carries icon+title+caption+expandable instructions+a
conditional Start/Mark-complete/Completed state, which doesn't fit
list_row's simpler title+caption shape, so the existing bespoke
st.container(border=True) cards were kept exactly as they were."""
