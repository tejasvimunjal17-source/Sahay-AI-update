"""pages/government_services.py — PHASE 4: polished rendering of
content/government_services.py's five-section structure (what/who/how/
official link/note). No URLs, phone numbers, eligibility rules, or
procedures are invented anywhere in this file — every fact-shaped claim
comes from the content module, which you edit directly.

PHASE 6C: header swapped from a hand-rolled `st.markdown("### ...")` to
the shared components.page_components.page_header — the "🇮🇳" that used
to be inline in the title string is now the header's `icon` argument.
No description was added (none existed before — per the Phase 6C
instruction to use None rather than invent one). Everything below the
header (the safety note and the per-service card loop) is byte-identical
to before: same fields, same fallback strings, same
`GOVERNMENT_SERVICES` import, same link-button/"pending verification"
logic."""
