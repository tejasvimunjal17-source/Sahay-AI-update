"""pages/overview.py — Home dashboard.

PHASE 1 VALIDATION UPDATE: replaced empty "—" metric placeholders with
clearly-labeled sample/demo figures so the dashboard reads as an
interactive product preview rather than a grid of blank boxes. Every
card is explicitly captioned "Demo data" — nothing here is a real user's
data, and no health/mood statistic is implied to be clinically meaningful.

PHASE 6D: header + its existing intro sentence swapped from
`st.markdown("### ...")` + a separate `st.write(...)` into a single
components.page_components.render_page_header call — the intro sentence
becomes the header's `description` argument verbatim (nothing reworded,
nothing invented). Everything below (safety_note, the demo-data caption,
the 4 metric_card calls, the spacer, and the accent_card + its
sahay_page="companion" navigation) is byte-identical to before."""
